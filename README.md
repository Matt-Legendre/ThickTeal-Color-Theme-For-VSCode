# ThickTeal Color Theme for VSCode :computer:

## Warning: Work in Progress :hammer:  

You will find this surprising but this theme will be predominantly <u>teal~ish</u>  
Also I will make liberal use of the **bold** fontstyle  
Because I like it and this is my theme and it works well with my favorite font : *Cascadia Code*  

It will be awesome, eventually  :unicorn:

Have a nice day my good sir or lady and code responsibly  :penguin:
